* Usage
** DirectFB
   To build everything run

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   make dfb-all
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Nfsroot
   For now we do not have proper nfsroot but there is a script you can
   run to get root at your fs.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   /homes/zynqfs/init.sh
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   That will run the init scripts as expected.

** Debug
   You may run =debug.sh <program-in-bin>= to debug something running
   on the board's gdbserver.
